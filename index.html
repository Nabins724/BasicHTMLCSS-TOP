                        that captivates observers with their undulating swaths of green, purple, and red lights dancing
                        across the sky12.</p>

                        The northern lights are created when energized particles from the sun slam into Earth's upper atmosphere at speeds of up to 45 million mph (72 million kph), but our planet's magnetic field protects us from the onslaught.

                    <p>The bright colors of the Northern Lights are dictated by the chemical composition of Earthâ€™s
                        atmosphere, with red hues produced by nitrogen molecules and green produced by oxygen molecules.
